# Indeed Job Scraper

This Python script allows you to scrape job postings from Indeed.com. It demonstrates how to work with pagination, extract job titles, salary information, company names, and job summaries from the site. The scraped data is saved as a CSV file for easy analysis in Excel.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- BeautifulSoup (version X.X.X)
- Requests (version X.X.X)

You can install the required packages using pip:
